    Overview<br /><br />
    mi-app is a cutting-edge mobile application built using Flutter and the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. 
    The app is already live but we are continuously working to fine-tune, tweak, and extend its functionality to provide an exceptional user experience.<br /><br />
    Features<br /><br />
    Admin Panel<br /><br />
    mi-app includes a powerful admin panel that allows administrators to manage various aspects of the application. Admins have the ability to add custom invite videos and other media content that can be easily shared with contacts via SMS.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is completed for the major features looking to add badges and a way to add categories to the invites.<br /><br />
    Custom Invite Videos<br /><br />
    The admin panel enables administrators to upload and manage custom invite videos. These videos can be tailored to suit specific campaigns or branding requirements. With just a few clicks, admins can select the desired video and share it with their contacts.<br /><br />
    SMS Integration<br /><br />
    mi-app integrates seamlessly with SMS services, allowing users to share invite videos and media content directly with their contacts. By leveraging SMS as a communication channel, mi-app ensures widespread reach and engagement with its target audience.<br /><br />
    Advanced Tracking Capabilities<br /><br />
    The app offers advanced tracking capabilities to gather valuable insights into user engagement. It tracks various events such as when a prospect clicks the shared link, starts watching the video, completes the video, and even when they click on a specific button on the landing page. This data empowers administrators to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns and make 
    data-driven decisions.<br /><br />
    Future Extensions<br /><br />
    We are committed to continuously improving mi-app and expanding its functionality. Some of the future extensions we are considering include:<br /><br />
    - Enhancing the admin panel for more intuitive content management.<br />
    - Introducing additional sharing options, such as email or social media platforms.<br />
    - Implementing user analytics to gain deeper insights into user behavior.<br />
    - Integrating third-party APIs for enhanced functionality and integrations.<br /><br /><br />
    mi-app is an innovative mobile application built with Flutter and the MERN stack. Its focus on providing a seamless user experience, along with the powerful admin panel and advanced tracking capabilities, sets it apart from other applications in the
